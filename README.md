**[new CodeCamp 2014 Presentation](http://newcodecamp.com/Public/Session/7)**

We've all written great applications before, but how many of us have to actually write installers to distribute this software?  Have you ever needed to deploy a custom utility you wrote to multiple machines on the domain or install a Windows Service on one of the production servers and instead of trying to build an installer, you resorted to writing a batch file, VBScript, or PowerShell script?  ClickOnce and app stores make it easy to distribute software, but only in certain scenarios.  There are still plenty of times we find the need for an installer.  Come find out how to easily build an installer using WiX.

WiX is a set of tools that allows you to create Windows Installer-based deployment packages for your application.  In this introductory session, we will focus on building the WiX definition files to easily accomplish basic tasks such as installing files, creating services and web applications, and running custom tasks such as deploying a database.  You will also learn a little about the Microsoft Installer and the structure of an MSI file in order to better understand what it is that WiX can provide to you.
